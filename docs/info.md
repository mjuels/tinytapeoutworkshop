## How it works

The value of inputs 1 and 2 are read, and the corresponding value is shown in decimal on the display.
If both 1 and 2 are set, the display shows nothing.

## How to test

Set none of the inputs - The display is off.
Set input 1 - Display should read 1.
Set input 2 - Display should read 2.
Set both of the inputs - The display is off.

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
